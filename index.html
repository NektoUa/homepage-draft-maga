                            Lost everything...

                            <h5>2020</h5>
                            <b>Keep America Great!</b> We almost won!

                            <h5>2017</h5>
                            Became <b>45th president</b> of the United States

                            <h5>2016</h5>
                            Won election race with 77 votes more than Clinton, yippe-kee-yay!

                            <h5>2015</h5>
                            Became the most important Republican nominating for presidential election run

                            <h5>2009</h5>
                            Changed my mind and became Republican again

                            <h5>2005</h5>
                            Started <i>Trump University</i> with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny: no grades,
                            certificates
                            and other bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management
                            entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. <b>98% students!!!</b> gave positive reviews while
                            studying,
                            however some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University after the
                            course. I had to pay $25 million to settle that...

                            <h5>2002</h5>
                            Acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the Trump
                            Park Avenue. I sure do like my surname!

                            <h5>2001</h5>
                            Completed <i>Trump World Tower</i> and joined the Democratic Party

                            <h5>1999</h5>
                            Started buying golf courses. They are very cheap, I have 18 of them now in USA and abroad!
                            Also switched to the Reform Party that year

                            <h5>1997</h5>
                            Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River, which was named Trump Place. Me
                            and the other investors sold our shares for $1.8 billion and that was then the biggest
                            residential sale in the history of New York City

                            <h5>1996</h5>
                            Acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story
                            skyscraper on Wall Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the
                            <i>Trump Building</i>

                            <h5>1994</h5>
                            Refurbished the Gulf and Western Building on Columbus Circle, turned it into a 44-story
                            luxury property known as <i>Trump International Hotel and Tower</i>

                            <h5>1989 ― 1992</h5>
                            Ran a second hand airline called Trump Shuttle. What a waste of money, I had to sell it, now
                            it is American Airlines Shuttle, btw

                            <h5>1989, 1990</h5>
                            Learned about Tour de France and decided to hold my very own Tour de Trump. Is America not
                            great enough for that cycling competition?

                            <h5>1988</h5>
                            Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million, invested $50 million to restore the
                            building and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and
                            sold it for a lot of cash in 1995)

                            <h5>1987</h5>
                            Registered as a Republican

                            <h5>1985</h5>
                            I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can join
                            if you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very
                            expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana
                            became a manager, because she is another Trump!

                            <h5>1983</h5>
                            I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's play schedule
                            and filed an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing
                            so good now, but back then they were great!

                            <h5>1980</h5>
                            Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented
                            Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features.
                            All this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is
                            "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the
                            same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the
                            work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!

                            <h5>1978</h5>
                            Purchased a 50 percent stake in the derelict Commodore Hotel and turned it
                            into the Grand
                            Hyatt Hotel in 2 years of remodeling

                            <h5>1971</h5>
                            Was promoted to president of the company and renamed it The Trump Organization

                            <h5>1968</h5>
                            Began my career at my father's real estate development company, <i>Elizabeth Trump & Son</i>

                            <h5>1946</h5>
                            I was born
